# Deployment

## Environments

- **Local**: PG17+PostGIS (port 5433), `pnpm dev`, worker via `pnpm --filter @exactpoint/worker dev`.
- **Staging/Production**: Railway project `exactpoint` — services `web` (Next.js), `worker` (pg-boss), `postgres` (PostGIS image `postgis/postgis:17-3.6` + volume). Cloudflare takes DNS/CDN/R2/Turnstile once the domain exists; until then the Railway `*.up.railway.app` domain serves staging.

## Railway

- Both `web` and `worker` deploy from the repo root (pnpm workspace needs the full tree); each service sets its own start command:
  - web: `pnpm --filter @exactpoint/web start` (build: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter @exactpoint/web build`)
  - worker: `pnpm --filter @exactpoint/worker start`
- Migrations run as the web service's pre-deploy command: `pnpm --filter @exactpoint/db migrate`.
- Required variables per service: `DATABASE_URL` (internal network URL), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `NODE_ENV=production`.
- The Railway API token is **not** stored in the repo; CLI auth via `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` env var locally. Rotate it after initial setup.

## Rules

- Never edit production tables manually — migrations only (spec §54).
- Keep production changes reversible; database backups before destructive migrations.
- DNS cutover to exactpointapplianceservices.com happens in Phase 12 with Cloudflare proxy + TLS.
